***NOTE**: this is about displaying greater-than-sRGB still images on computer displays, not the bracketing postprocessing technique that has been popular over the last decade or so*

# tl;dr

1. acquire a greated-than-sRGB source image, usually a camera raw file
2. generate an OpenEXR image using Affinity Photo
3. convert that OpenEXR image into a PQ-mapped PNG file
4. convert that PNG file to a JPEG XL file
5. enable JPEG-XL in Chrome
6. profit!

*TODO: write the rest of this*
